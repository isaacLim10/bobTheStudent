# Bob the Student
## Introduction
The Bob project is a project that utilises a wide variety of Python libraries to generate Powerpoint presentations about a person in the style of a (bad) school student-copied and pasted content straight off Wikipedia, low quality anti-aliased pictures and a kind-of but not really bibliography. 
The purpose of this is not to solve a world problem or prove that an idea could be functional. It is simply there to mock every presentation that I have seen with copied and pasted content and people reading off the slides. 
## Functionality
* Copying and pasting off Wikipedia
* Generating (bad) Powerpoints
* Low quality pictures
